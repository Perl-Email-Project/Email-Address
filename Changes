          thanks to MIYAGAWA and KEVINR for tests for the above!

1.884     2006-12-04
          fix phrase-quoting behavior by always quoting the phrase, if given
          this fixes bug 13387; thanks, Dave Rolsky!

1.883     2006-11-25
          resolve bug 23565, as_string didn't work on 5.8.0 (weird!)
          improve skip behavior for cache-cow.t with older Scalar::Util
          restore as_string
          issue deprecation warning if $STRINGIFY is changed

1.882     2006-11-22
          fix bug 21270, do not allow changes to objects to pollute the cache
          packaging improvements
          make test suite easier to manage
          improve honesty of documentation (we are not complete, (yet))

1.881     2006-11-20
          Basically: fixes a case where regex never returns.
          resolve bug 23187 by slighly diluting the solution to 22991, which is
            a more marginal problem than that of 23187, in practical terms

1.880     2006-11-11
          resolve bug 22991, support obs-phrase construct
          this creates a significant slowdown, sadly, but nothing to rival bug
            16320

1.871     2006-10-12
1.870     2006-08-10
          restore as_string
          issue deprecation warning if $STRINGIFY is changed

1.86      2006-07-21
          update docs
          tweak regex for approximate 50% performance boost
          ...but bug 16320 is still true: Email::Address can be VERY slow
          https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16320


1.85      2006-07-07
          add disable_cache and enable_cache methods (bug 19163, thanks ADAMK)

1.80      2004-10-22
          With long mal-formed comment structures, backtracking was causing
          parse() to "hang." This was tracked down and fixed.  (Tim O'Brien
          reported this).

1.7       2004-10-12
          $comment was initialized twice, oops.
          Lowered the default nested comment level from five to two, cut regex
          in half.

1.6       2004-10-05
          Only define package variables if they haven't already been defined.

1.5       2004-10-05
          Implemented the remainder of the spec for CFWS. This was
          intentionally left out of previous versions because it increases the
          size of the regex ten fold. I was surprised to learn that the
          slowdown was only 33%, leaving Email-Address faster than its
          competition by a factor of two in the benchmarks I've created (which
          makes them subjective, I suppose).

1.3       2004-08-15
          name() was incorrectly fixing up a comment.

1.2       2004-06-02
          Added original() method.
          Allowed access to key regexes.

1.1       2004-05-26
          Initial version.
