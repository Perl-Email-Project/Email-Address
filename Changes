1.882  2006-11-21
  - packaging improvements
  - make test suite easier to manage
  - improve honesty of documentation (we are not complete, (yet))

1.881  2006-11-20
  - Basically: fixes a case where regex never returns.
    resolve bug 23187 by slighly diluting the solution to 22991, which is a
    more marginal problem than that of 23187, in practical terms

1.880  2006-11-11
  - resolve bug 22991, support obs-phrase construct
    this creates a significant slowdown, sadly, but nothing to rival bug 16320

1.871  2006-10-12

  - previous version had been clobberred by apparently not-in-svn 1.870
    it said:
      - restore as_string
      - issue deprecation warning if $STRINGIFY is changed

1.861  2006-10-12

  - don't bother trying to scan or warn about undef/empty parse string
    (thanks, JESSE)

1.86   2006-07-21

  - update docs
  - tweak regex for approximate 50% performance boost
    ...but bug 16320 is still true: Email::Address can be VERY slow
    https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16320
  

1.85   2006-07-07

  - add disable_cache and enable_cache methods (bug 19163, thanks ADAMK)

1.80   2004-10-22

  - With long mal-formed comment structures, backtracking was causing
    parse() to "hang." This was tracked down and fixed.
    (Tim O'Brien reported this).

1.7    2004-10-12

  - $comment was initialized twice, oops.
  - Lowered the default nested comment level from five to two, cut
    regex in half.

1.6    2004-10-05

  - Only define package variables if they haven't already been defined.

1.5    2004-10-05

  - Implemented the remainder of the spec for CFWS. This was intentionally
    left out of previous versions because it increases the size of the regex
    ten fold. I was surprised to learn that the slowdown was only 33%,
    leaving Email-Address faster than its competition by a factor of two in
    the benchmarks I've created (which makes them subjective, I suppose).

1.3    2004-08-15

  - name() was incorrectly fixing up a comment.

1.2    2004-06-02

  - Added original() method.
  - Allowed access to key regexes.

1.1    2004-05-26

  - Initial version.
